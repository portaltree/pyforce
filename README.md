Requests

Secrets

Getting StartedTo start brute forcing, you must first install the dependencies.

Dependenciespython -m pip install requests PySimpleGUI

InstallationFork the repository

git clone https://github.com/asimo10/pyforce.git

Cd to the directory

cd C://cd/to/the/clone

Run pyforce.py in python

python pyforce.py

After that, a GUI like this should pop up

UsageTo start using PyForce I recommend using XAMPP to test it. After setting up XAMPP, copy the PHP code below.

<?php

if ($_POST[usr] == "admin" and $_POST[psw] == "69"){
  print "true";
}
else{
  print "false";
}

?>
<form method="post">
  <input name="usr" type="text">
  <input name="psw" type="text">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

Now, all you have to do is add each info into the input boxes.

Now, all you have to do is click on the Brute Force! button to start.

After you click it passwords will start printing on the console. Now all you have to do is sit back and wait while the program is guessing the password.

If a password match, a message like below should appear and the PyForce program should stop.

69

Success!
Found password after 61 times
Username: admin 
Password: 69

Process finished with exit code 0
